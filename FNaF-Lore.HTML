        <h1>the lore>></h1>
        <p>ok so basically FNaF begins when 2 friends, william afton & henry emily, start a business called <b>"Fredbear's family diner"</b> in the 1970s (either 1973 or 1979, im not that good at dates so im takin em from google). william had 3 kids, (2 sons and 1 daughter) named michael(oldest), crying child(no confirmed name :/ also middle child) & elizabeth(youngest & persumed to be the favorite).
         its also persumed that michael was the hated/unmportant child, as we see from midnight motorist in which the character we play as is presumed to be william and the son is michael. back on the topic, michael bullied crying child (who well call cc/bv from now on), and tbh, the only reason id see him doing that is cuz he wanted attention from his father. in 1983, on bvs bday, michael planned a prank 
         that went too far. he put ccs head in fredbears mouth, and cuz of bvs tears, the springlocks malfunctioned and caused <b>the bite of 83.</b> its commonly mistaken for the bite of 87, which happened in 1987 when nightgaurd jeremy fitzgerald got his frontal lobe bitten by whats presumed to be mangle (although the one w most evidence is withered foxy). back to the bite, michael regreted this ofc, and his 
         father, william, hated him even more. when bv/cc died, william promised to put him back together, one way or another. fredbears family diner had to close due to the incident, and henry n william rebranded into freddy fazbears pizza. in a grieving state, william blamed the springlock failure on <i>henry</i>, the one who made fredbear. after all, why didnt henry design them springlocks better? in a fit of rage (and in 1983 too), 
         william drove to the pizzaria and saw charlie crying outside, where the bullies locked her and blocked the puppet(the animatronic henry made to guard the charlie). william took this oppritunity and killed charlie outside freddys, where he hid her in an alley. the puppet escaped, immedietly went to charlies corpse and her soul posessed the puppet.
